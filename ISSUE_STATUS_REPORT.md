## Issues Still Open ❌

### Critical Issues:
1. **#40: XGBoost Booster objects lack predict_proba method**
   - Impact: 4 PAT model tests skipped
   - Workaround: Using dummy models for testing
   - Fix needed: Update model serialization format

### Documentation Issues:
2. **#27: v0.2.0 Does Not Have True Ensemble**
   - This is by design - v0.3.0 will have true ensemble
   - Current state is documented correctly

3. **#25: XGBoost and PAT have different temporal windows**
   - XGBoost: 24hr forecast
   - PAT: Current state embeddings
   - Needs documentation clarification

### Enhancement Requests:
4. **#36: Implement true streaming pipeline**
   - Nice to have, not critical
   - Current streaming parser handles large files

5. **#31: Add progress indication**
   - Enhancement for better UX
   - Not blocking functionality

6. **#32: Optimize feature extraction pipeline**
   - Performance enhancement
   - Current performance is acceptable

### Deployment Issues:
7. **#30: Docker deployment fails**
   - Needs investigation
   - Workaround: Direct Python installation works

## Current State Summary
