PAT Sequence Builder Service

Builds 7-day activity sequences for the Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer (PAT).
Based on the Dartmouth study: "AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data"

Key requirements:
- 10,080 minute sequences (7 days × 24 hours × 60 minutes)
- Patch size of 18 minutes (560 patches for PAT-L)
- Z-score normalization
- Handles missing data with zero-filling

Design Principles:
- Builder Pattern for sequence construction
- Immutable value objects
- Clear separation of concerns
