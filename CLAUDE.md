# AI Agent Guide - Big Mood Detector

This guide helps AI agents understand and work with the Big Mood Detector codebase effectively.

**Last Updated**: July 24, 2025 (v0.4.0)
**Current Status**: Pure PyTorch PAT Implementation - Paper Parity Achieved!

## Mission

Build and maintain a clinical-grade bipolar mood prediction system that analyzes Apple Health data using validated ML models to provide actionable insights for mental health management.

## Key Commands

```bash
# Setup environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev,ml,monitoring]"

# Run application
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process data/health_auto_export/
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py predict data/health_auto_export/ --report
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py serve

# Development workflow
make test        # Run all tests
make quality     # Lint + type check + test
make dev         # Start development server
```

## Architecture Overview

The system follows Clean Architecture with clear boundaries:

```
Interfaces (CLI/API) → Application (Use Cases) → Domain (Business Logic) ← Infrastructure (ML/DB)
```

**Key principles:**
- Domain layer has NO external dependencies
- All data flows through use cases
- ML models are abstracted behind interfaces
- Repository pattern for data access

## Where to Make Changes

### Adding New Features
1. Start in `domain/` - define entities and business rules
2. Create use case in `application/use_cases/`
3. Implement infrastructure in `infrastructure/`
4. Add interface in `interfaces/cli/` or `interfaces/api/`
5. Write tests first (TDD approach)

### Modifying ML Models
- Model interfaces: `domain/services/mood_predictor.py`
- Implementations: `infrastructure/ml_models/`
- Weights: `model_weights/` (do not commit large files)
- Fine-tuning: `infrastructure/fine_tuning/`

### Data Processing
- Parsers: `infrastructure/parsers/json/` and `xml/`
- Feature extraction: `domain/services/feature_extraction_service.py`
- Aggregators: `domain/services/*_aggregator.py`

## Critical Files

**DO NOT MODIFY without understanding impact:**
- `domain/value_objects/clinical_thresholds.py` - DSM-5 validated thresholds
- `infrastructure/ml_models/xgboost_models.py` - Model loading logic
- `infrastructure/parsers/xml/streaming_parser.py` - Memory-efficient parsing
- `core/config.py` - Environment and path configuration

**Key configuration:**
- Sleep window merging: 3.75 hours (domain constant)
- Activity sequences: 1440 minutes/day
- Model paths: Configured in settings
- Clinical thresholds: Based on research papers
- Performance: Use OptimizedAggregationPipeline for large datasets (v0.2.3)

## Critical Bug Fixes

### XML Processing Timeout (Fixed in v0.2.3)
**Problem:** XML processing timed out for 500MB+ files due to O(n×m) aggregation complexity.

**Solution:** Created `OptimizedAggregationPipeline` with pre-indexing:
```python
# Use optimized pipeline for large datasets
from big_mood_detector.application.services.optimized_aggregation_pipeline import OptimizedAggregationPipeline

# Configure to skip expensive calculations
config = AggregationConfig(
    enable_dlmo_calculation=False,  # Skip expensive DLMO
    enable_circadian_analysis=False  # Skip circadian when not needed
)
pipeline = OptimizedAggregationPipeline(config=config)
```

**Impact:** 7x performance improvement - 365 days now processes in 17.4s (was 120s+ timeout).

### Sleep Duration Calculation (Fixed)
**Problem:** Sleep duration was incorrectly calculated as `sleep_percentage * 24`, which only counted merged sleep windows and missed fragmented sleep periods.

**Solution:** Use `SleepAggregator.aggregate_daily()` for accurate total sleep calculation. The fix is in `aggregation_pipeline.py`:
```python
# CORRECT: Use SleepAggregator for accurate duration
accurate_hours = self._get_actual_sleep_duration(sleep_records, current_date)

# WRONG: DO NOT use sleep_percentage * 24
# This only counts merged windows, missing fragmented sleep
```

**Impact:** Sleep baselines now correctly show ~7.5 hours instead of 2-5 hours for typical users.

**CI Guard:** Run `scripts/check_no_sleep_percentage.sh` to prevent regression.

### Baseline Repository Race Conditions (Fixed in v0.2.4)
**Problem:** FileBaselineRepository tests failed under parallel execution due to shared temp directories causing race conditions.

**Solution:** Use pytest's `tmp_path` fixture and `xdist_group` marker:
```python
@pytest.mark.xdist_group(name="baseline")  # Keep tests on same worker
class TestFileBaselineRepository:
    @pytest.fixture
    def repo_path(self, tmp_path: Path) -> Path:
        """Unique temp directory per test."""
        return tmp_path / "baselines"
```

**Impact:** All tests now pass reliably under parallel execution.

### Type Safety Issues (Fixed in v0.2.4)
**Problem:** 15 mypy errors across orchestrator_adapter, process_health_data_use_case, and main.py.

**Solution:** 
- Added proper type annotations for empty lists
- Fixed PATSequence constructor with correct parameters
- Added type declaration for clinical_extractor
- Removed unnecessary type: ignore comments

**Impact:** Full type safety across 159 source files - no mypy errors.

### Feature Engineering Orchestrator Integration (Added in v0.2.4)
**Enhancement:** Integrated FeatureEngineeringOrchestrator for automatic validation and anomaly detection.

**Implementation:** Used Adapter pattern to maintain backward compatibility:
```python
# application/adapters/orchestrator_adapter.py
class OrchestratorAdapter:
    """Makes FeatureEngineeringOrchestrator compatible with ClinicalFeatureExtractor interface."""
    
    def extract_clinical_features(self, ...):
        # Validates features automatically
        # Detects anomalies
        # Tracks feature importance
        # Provides completeness reports
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic validation of all extracted features
- Anomaly detection for unusual patterns
- Data quality scores and completeness reports
- Feature importance tracking
- Performance caching for repeated calculations

### PAT-L Training Normalization Bug (Fixed in v0.4.0)
**Problem:** PAT-L training was stuck at AUC 0.4756 (worse than random) due to fixed normalization statistics removing all discriminative signal.

**Root Cause:** NHANES processor used hardcoded normalization values:
```python
# WRONG: Fixed statistics
NHANES_STATS = {"2013-2014": {"mean": 2.5, "std": 2.0}}
# This caused all sequences to have mean -1.24 ±0.001
```

**Solution:** Compute normalization from actual training data:
```python
# Reverse bad normalization and recompute
X_train_raw = X_train * 2.0 + 2.5
train_mean = X_train_raw.mean()
train_std = X_train_raw.std()
X_train = (X_train_raw - train_mean) / train_std
```

**Impact:** 
- Before: AUC stuck at 0.4756 for 70+ epochs
- After: AUC 0.5622 → 0.5788+ and climbing
- PAT-L now approaching paper performance (0.610)

**Training Scripts:** See `scripts/train_pat_l_run_now.py` for the fix and `docs/pat_l_training_findings.md` for full analysis.

## Testing Requirements

**Before committing:**
1. All tests must pass: `make test`
2. Coverage must stay >90%: `make coverage`
3. Type checking clean: `make type-check`
4. No linting errors: `make lint`

**Test categories:**
- `pytest -m unit` - Fast domain tests
- `pytest -m integration` - DB and parser tests
- `pytest -m ml` - Model validation tests
- `pytest -m clinical` - Clinical threshold tests
- `pytest -m performance` - Performance tests (excluded from default runs)

## Performance Guidelines

**Memory usage:**
- XML parser uses <100MB for any file size
- Feature extraction: ~1KB per day per user
- Model inference: <100ms per prediction

**Processing targets (v0.2.3):**
- XML parsing: 33MB/s (>40k records/second)
- Aggregation: 17.4s for 365 days (was 120s+)
- Feature extraction: <1s per year of data
- API response: <200ms average

## Clinical Accuracy

**Key metrics from research:**
- Depression detection: AUC 0.80
- Mania detection: AUC 0.98
- Hypomania detection: AUC 0.95

**Critical features:**
- Circadian phase (top predictor)
- Sleep duration and efficiency
- Activity patterns (1440-min sequences)
- Heart rate variability

## Common Tasks

### Process New Data Format
1. Add parser to `infrastructure/parsers/`
2. Register in `ParserFactory`
3. Map to domain entities
4. Add tests with sample data

### Add Clinical Feature
1. Define in `domain/services/feature_extraction_service.py`
2. Implement calculation logic
3. Add to feature vector
4. Update model if needed
5. Validate against clinical literature

### Improve Performance
1. Profile with `cProfile` first
2. Check for O(n×m) complexity (use pre-indexing)
3. Use `OptimizedAggregationPipeline` for large datasets
4. Configure expensive calculations (DLMO, circadian)
5. Consider caching (Redis)
6. Optimize hot paths only

### Enable Personal Calibration
Personal baselines improve prediction accuracy by adapting to individual patterns:

```python
# In your pipeline configuration
from big_mood_detector.infrastructure.repositories.file_baseline_repository import FileBaselineRepository

# Create baseline repository
baseline_repo = FileBaselineRepository(Path("data/baselines"))

# Pass to pipeline
pipeline = MoodPredictionPipeline(
    baseline_repository=baseline_repo,
    user_id="unique_user_123"  # Per-user baselines
)

# Process data - baselines auto-update
features = pipeline.process_health_data(...)
```

**What gets calibrated:**
- Sleep duration baseline (individual's normal)
- Activity levels (steps, exercise patterns)
- Heart rate & HRV baselines
- Circadian phase (DLMO estimate)

**Benefits:**
- Athletes won't trigger false positives from low HR
- Night owls get accurate predictions despite late sleep
- Detects deviations from YOUR normal, not population average

## Debugging Tips

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Profile memory usage
mprof run python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process large_file.xml
mprof plot

# Check SQL queries
export SQLALCHEMY_ECHO=true

# Trace execution
python -m trace -t src/big_mood_detector/main.py process data/
```

## Context Budget

When working on this codebase, prioritize loading:
1. Domain layer files (small, pure Python)
2. Relevant use case
3. Specific infrastructure needed
4. Tests for the area you're modifying

Avoid loading:
- All infrastructure at once
- Reference repos (unless needed)
- Large test fixtures
- Generated documentation

## Current Status

**✅ Fixed Issues:**
- ~~XGBoost feature mismatch~~ → Seoul features working
- ~~PAT cannot make predictions~~ → Full depression models trained
- ~~Weight conversion errors~~ → Near-perfect parity achieved

## Critical Setup Requirements

### Pretrained Model Weights (REQUIRED)
The PAT models **require** pretrained weights to function. Without these, training will fail.

**Location:** `model_weights/pat/pretrained/`
- PAT-L_29k_weights.h5 (7.7MB)
- PAT-M_29k_weights.h5 (3.9MB)
- PAT-S_29k_weights.h5 (1.1MB)

**Common Issue:** If weights are in `data-dump/model_weights/`, copy them:
```bash
mkdir -p model_weights/pat/pretrained/
cp data-dump/model_weights/pat/pretrained/PAT-*.h5 model_weights/pat/pretrained/
```

### Training Data Location
**NHANES data:** `data/cache/nhanes_pat_data_subsetNone.npz` (503KB)
- This file is auto-generated on first run if missing
- Contains preprocessed NHANES depression screening data

### Python Environment Setup (WSL2/Linux)
**Required:** Python 3.12+ (project constraint in pyproject.toml)
```bash
# Install Python 3.12 if needed
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3.12 python3.12-venv python3.12-dev

# Create virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv .venv-wsl
source .venv-wsl/bin/activate

# Critical: Install numpy<2.0 FIRST
pip install 'numpy<2.0'

# Then PyTorch with CUDA
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

# Then other dependencies
pip install transformers h5py scikit-learn pandas matplotlib tqdm

# Install project
pip install -e ".[dev,ml,monitoring]"
```

### Common Friction Points
1. **ModuleNotFoundError: big_mood_detector**
   - Solution: `export PYTHONPATH="/path/to/project/src:$PYTHONPATH"`
   - And ensure `pip install -e .` was run

2. **NumPy 2.x conflicts**
   - Solution: Always install `numpy<2.0` FIRST before any other packages

3. **Missing pretrained weights**
   - Error: "No pretrained weights at model_weights/pat/pretrained/PAT-L_29k_weights.h5"
   - Solution: Copy weights to correct location (see above)

4. **WSL2 network timeouts**
   - Solution: Update /etc/resolv.conf with Google DNS (8.8.8.8)
