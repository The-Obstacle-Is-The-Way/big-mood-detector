## 🏆 Current State: All Tests Green, Branches Synchronized

All critical issues have been resolved and the codebase is in a stable, production-ready state.

## 📊 Branch Status

### ✅ Synchronized Branches
- **main**: `8af66865` - Has all flaky test fixes and robustness improvements
- **staging**: `8af66865` - Identical to main
- **development**: `b896ebb3` - Has main + timeout configuration (1 commit ahead)

All branches contain the comprehensive fixes for test stability and code robustness.

## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

### Test Stability (All Fixed) ✅
- **API Startup Test**: Uses dynamic port allocation, removed flaky marker
- **E2E Pipeline Tests**: Fixed Python path issues with `sys.executable`
- **OpenAPI Contract Test**: Handles dynamic schema naming correctly
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper conditional imports prevent import errors

### Code Improvements ✅
- **Path Resolution**: Fixed PROJECT_ROOT calculation (4 levels up)
- **Unit Tests Added**: Path resolution tests prevent future regressions
- **Timeout Configuration**: Increased to 300s for heavy integration tests
- **Data Protection**: Enhanced .gitignore for data directories

## 📈 Recent PRs & Issues Resolved

- **PR #42**: Progress indication for XML parsing - MERGED ✅
- **PR #41**: Release v0.2.2 with critical fixes - MERGED ✅
- **PR #37**: XML date range filtering - MERGED ✅
- **Issue #31**: Progress indication - CLOSED ✅
- **Issue #33**: Date range filtering - CLOSED ✅

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The codebase now has:
- ✅ All tests passing reliably (no flaky markers needed)
- ✅ Proper error handling throughout
- ✅ Progress indication for long operations
- ✅ XML date range filtering for large files
- ✅ Robust path resolution with tests
- ✅ Clean branch synchronization

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Push timeout config from development to main/staging
2. **Tag Release**: v0.2.2 is ready to be tagged
3. **Future Optimization**: Consider splitting test suite (unit vs E2E) for faster CI
