# Critical Documentation Update Summary

**Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Issue:** External audit revealed documentation overstated "out-of-the-box" capabilities

## Key Findings

### 1. PAT Model Reality Check ⚠️
- **What we claimed:** Both models work without labels
- **Reality:** PAT only includes encoder weights, NOT classification heads
- **Impact:** PAT can only output embeddings, not mood predictions

### 2. XGBoost Status ✅
- **Verified:** Full model weights included (.pkl files)
- **Confirmed:** Works immediately for mood predictions
- **Accuracy:** As stated in papers (98% AUC for mania)

## Documentation Changes Made

### 1. IMPORTANT_PLEASE_READ.md
- Added clear distinction between XGBoost (works) and PAT (encoder only)
- Added section on how to obtain PAT classification heads
- Corrected "NO LABELS REQUIRED" claim to be XGBoost-specific

### 2. README.md
- Added warning about PAT limitations in header
- Updated model status section with ✅/⚠️/❌ indicators
- Clarified ensemble is non-functional without PAT heads

### 3. MODEL_LABELING_REQUIREMENTS.md
- Complete rewrite of executive summary
- Corrected all claims about PAT functionality
- Added practical guidance for users

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Contact PAT authors for classification heads
2. Update ensemble code to handle missing PAT predictions
3. Add warning messages when PAT-dependent features are used

### Medium Term
1. Implement PAT fine-tuning pipeline
2. Create tutorial for obtaining/training PAT heads
3. Consider removing ensemble until fully functional

### Long Term
1. Collaborate with PAT authors for official integration
2. Train our own classification heads on relevant data
3. Validate full ensemble on clinical cohort

## User Impact

### What Works Now
- XGBoost predictions (depression, mania, hypomania)
- Personal baseline calibration
- Clinical reporting for XGBoost results
- All data processing pipelines

### What Doesn't Work
- PAT mood predictions
- Ensemble predictions
- Any feature advertising "depression detection via PAT"

## Communication Strategy

1. **Be Transparent:** Acknowledge the limitation upfront
2. **Focus on Strengths:** XGBoost alone is still valuable (98% AUC)
3. **Provide Path Forward:** Clear instructions for PAT heads
4. **Manage Expectations:** This is research software, not a product

## Lessons Learned

1. **Verify Claims:** Always test actual functionality vs papers
2. **Read Fine Print:** PAT paper clearly states heads aren't included
3. **External Audits:** Valuable for catching overpromises
4. **Documentation Debt:** Regular audits prevent misinformation spread
