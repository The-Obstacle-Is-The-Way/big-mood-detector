# Sparse Temporal Health Data Research: 2025 Best Practices

## Executive Summary

After extensive research on handling sparse temporal health data with missing days and sensor misalignment, here are the key findings and recommendations for our big mood detector project.

## Key Challenges We Face

1. **Temporal Misalignment**: Sleep data (Jan-July 2025) vs Activity data (April-July 2025)
2. **Sparse Coverage**: Only 28 overlapping days out of ~180 days total
3. **Non-consecutive Days**: Data has gaps (e.g., May 15, 16, 17 then jump to May 28)
4. **Multi-sensor Fusion**: Different sampling rates and data availability

## Research Findings

### 1. TSFresh for Feature Extraction

**Relevance**: TSFresh is highly relevant but requires preprocessing for missing data.

- **Strengths**: 
  - Automatically extracts 794 time series features
  - Most features don't require fixed time intervals
  - Robust statistical feature selection
  
- **Limitations**:
  - Does NOT handle missing data automatically
  - Some features (FFT, etc.) need regular sampling
  - Requires domain-specific interpolation before use

**Recommendation**: Use TSFresh AFTER implementing proper data interpolation strategy.

### 2. Circadian Rhythm Analysis Best Practices (2024-2025)

**Optimal Measurement Duration**:
- 28-day recordings show strongest correlations with health outcomes
- Minimum 2-7 days for basic rhythm detection
- 1 day may suffice for stable populations (e.g., elderly)

**Missing Data Thresholds**:
- Exclude data if gaps exceed 6 hours
- Need at least 3 consecutive days for reliable circadian metrics

**Advanced Methods**:
- **GZLM-gamma models**: Better for non-negative actigraphy data than traditional cosinor
- **Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA)**: Model-free decomposition for irregular data
- **CircaCP algorithm**: Robust cosinor + change point detection

### 3. Sparse Data Handling Techniques (2025)

**State-of-the-Art Approaches**:

1. **Bayesian Neural Fields (BayesNF)**:
   - Domain-general spatiotemporal modeling
   - Robust uncertainty quantification
   - Good for interpolation and forecasting

2. **Diffusion Models**:
   - Population Aware Diffusion for Time Series (AAAI 2025)
   - Handles sparse temporal patterns

3. **Temporal Fusion**:
   - Particle filtering for multi-sensor fusion
   - Corrects for sensor artifacts

4. **CavePerception Framework** (IDA 2025):
   - Combines inverse and forward modeling
   - Specifically designed for sparse sensor networks

### 4. Wearable AI and Deep Learning (2025)

**Current Trends**:
- Self-supervised learning for accelerometer data
- Penalized Machine Learning (PML) for circadian analysis
- Automated feature extraction from population data

**Key Insight**: Deep learning requires careful validation with clinical data and standardized approaches.

## Proposed Solution Strategy

### Phase 1: Data Alignment and Interpolation

1. **Temporal Alignment**:
   ```python
   # Pseudo-code for alignment strategy
   - Find overlapping date ranges
   - Create unified timeline with all available dates
   - Mark missing data explicitly
   ```

2. **Smart Interpolation**:
   - Use domain-specific methods (not generic linear)
   - For sleep: Forward-fill within 24h windows
   - For activity: Use circadian-aware interpolation
   - For gaps > 6h: Mark as missing, don't interpolate

3. **Feature Window Adaptation**:
   - Use variable-length windows based on data availability
   - Weight features by data completeness
   - Implement "data sufficiency" metrics

### Phase 2: Robust Feature Extraction

1. **Multi-timescale Features**:
   - Daily features (when available)
   - Weekly aggregates (more robust to gaps)
   - Monthly trends (for sparse data)

2. **Missing-Aware Features**:
   - Missingness patterns as features
   - Data quality scores
   - Sensor availability indicators

3. **Ensemble Approach**:
   - TSFresh for dense periods
   - SSA for sparse/irregular periods
   - GZLM-gamma for circadian parameters

### Phase 3: Model Architecture

1. **Hierarchical Modeling**:
   - Level 1: Imputation model (BayesNF-style)
   - Level 2: Feature extraction
   - Level 3: XGBoost with missing indicators

2. **Uncertainty Quantification**:
   - Confidence intervals based on data density
   - Separate predictions for "high confidence" vs "sparse data" periods

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Implement data sufficiency checks
   - Create interpolation module with domain rules
   - Add missing data indicators to feature set

2. **Architecture Changes**:
   - Separate "dense data" and "sparse data" pipelines
   - Add confidence scoring to predictions
   - Implement fallback strategies for insufficient data

3. **Validation Strategy**:
   - Test on synthetic data with known gaps
   - Cross-validate on different sparsity levels
   - Clinical validation with domain experts

## Key Takeaway

The sparse, misaligned nature of real-world health data is not a bugâ€”it's a feature. Modern approaches embrace this sparsity rather than forcing dense representations. Our architecture should:

1. Be transparent about data limitations
2. Provide confidence-aware predictions
3. Use ensemble methods appropriate to data density
4. Never hide uncertainty behind interpolation
