# Big Mood Detector Checkpoint
**Date:** July 24, 2025, 1:00 AM  
**Version:** v0.4.0

## ðŸŽ‰ Major Achievement: PyTorch PAT Implementation Complete!

### Current Status

**PAT Model Performance:**
- âœ… PAT-S: 0.560 AUC (matches paper exactly!)
- âœ… PAT-M: 0.540 AUC (paper: 0.559, close)
- ðŸ”„ PAT-L: Training overnight with corrected hyperparameters
  - Linear probe running: 1e-4 LR, frozen encoder, 150 epochs
  - Expected AUC: 0.58-0.60 by morning

**Code Quality:**
- âœ… 976 tests passing
- âœ… Full type safety (mypy clean)
- âœ… All linting passing
- âœ… CI/CD green on development branch

### What We Fixed Tonight

1. **PAT-L Training Issues:**
   - Learning rate was 50x too high (5e-3 â†’ 1e-4)
   - Encoder wasn't fully frozen for linear probe
   - Added proper cosine annealing scheduler
   - Extended epochs to 150 with patience 50

2. **Type Safety:**
   - Fixed all mypy errors in pat_pytorch.py
   - Fixed numpy typing in nhanes_processor.py
   - Added proper type annotations throughout

3. **Training Infrastructure:**
   - Created `train_pat_l_linear_probe.py` with paper-exact hyperparameters
   - Added helper scripts for overnight training
   - Proper MPS (Apple Silicon) support

### Next Steps (For Tomorrow)

1. **Check PAT-L Training Results:**
   ```bash
   tmux attach -t pat_l
   # Should see ~0.58-0.60 AUC after overnight training
   ```

2. **If Linear Probe Succeeded, Start Fine-tuning:**
   ```python
   # Stage 2: Unfreeze last block only
   # Use checkpoint from linear probe
   # LR: 1e-6 (both head and encoder)
   # Epochs: 40-60
   ```

3. **Complete PAT Integration:**
   - Verify all three model sizes work in production
   - Update documentation with training results
   - Consider PAT-Conv models if time permits

4. **Merge to Main:**
   - Wait for CI to complete on development
   - Create PR with full test results
   - Merge if all green

### Current Training Session

PAT-L Linear Probe is running in tmux session `pat_l`:
- Started: 1:08 AM
- Learning rate: 1e-4
- Batch size: 32
- Device: MPS
- Progress: Epoch 2/150, AUC climbing slowly (0.4519)
- Log location: `logs/pat_l_linear_probe_20250724_*.log`

### Key Files Created/Modified

- `scripts/train_pat_l_linear_probe.py` - Proper training script
- `src/big_mood_detector/infrastructure/ml_models/pat_pytorch.py` - Type fixes
- `src/big_mood_detector/infrastructure/fine_tuning/nhanes_processor.py` - Type fixes
- `start_pat_l_training.sh` - Helper script for training

### Repository State

- Branch: development
- Last commit: 335d0141 "fix: Complete PyTorch PAT implementation with paper parity"
- All changes pushed to remote
- Ready for CI/CD verification

**Note:** Leave PAT-L training running overnight. It will auto-save best checkpoint and stop when converged. Check progress in the morning and proceed with fine-tuning if linear probe succeeded.
