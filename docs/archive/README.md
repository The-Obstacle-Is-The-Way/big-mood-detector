# Documentation Archive

This archive contains historical documentation, completed implementation plans, and superseded documents. These are preserved for reference but are not part of the active documentation.

## Archive Organization

### 📋 [completed/](completed/)
Implementation records for completed features:
- **Fine-tuning Pipeline** - Design and implementation docs
- **Labeling CLI** - Complete implementation documentation
- **PAT Integration** - Integration completion records
- **Refactoring** - Completed refactoring plans and progress

### 📐 [implementation-plans/](implementation-plans/)
Completed implementation plans that have been executed:
- `baseline_persistence_plan.md` - Personal baseline implementation (completed)
- `integration_implementation_plan.md` - System integration plan (completed)
- `domain_services_audit.md` - Domain layer audit that informed refactoring

### 🔧 [refactoring/](refactoring/)
Completed refactoring documentation:
- `REFACTORING_COMPLETE.md` - Final refactoring summary
- `phase3-pipeline-analysis.md` - Pipeline refactoring phase 3 analysis

### 📝 [planning/](planning/)
Outdated planning documents:
- `TDD_ACTIVITY_FEATURES_STATUS.md` - Activity features development tracking
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_FROM_REFERENCES.md` - Initial implementation planning
- `OPERATIONALIZATION_*.md` - Various operational planning docs

### 📦 [releases/](releases/)
Release-specific documentation:
- `RELEASE_NOTES_BASELINE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - Baseline feature release notes

### 🗂️ Other Archived Documents
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Original architecture (see current: [developer/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md](../developer/ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md))
- `README_OLD.md` - Previous version of main README
- `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Superseded technical docs
- `BIPOLAR_LITERATURE.md` - Old literature review (see current: [literature/](../literature/))
- `FEATURE_ENGINEERING_ANALYSIS.md` - Feature analysis that informed current implementation
- `sparse_temporal_data_research_2025.md` - Research on temporal data handling

## Why Archive?

These documents are preserved because they:
1. **Show project evolution** - How the architecture and approach developed
2. **Provide implementation context** - Why certain decisions were made
3. **Document completed work** - What was planned vs. what was built
4. **Support debugging** - Historical context for troubleshooting
