# PAT Depression Head Training - Critical Findings

## Executive Summary
After analyzing the PAT reference implementation and paper, we identified several critical misalignments between our implementation and the original approach that explain the poor performance (AUC ~0.11 vs expected ~0.59).

## Key Issues Found

### 1. **Patching Misalignment** 🚨 CRITICAL
**Finding**: PAT expects 560 patch tokens (10,080 minutes ÷ 18 = 560), but we're feeding raw 10,080 minute sequences.
- **Impact**: Model receives wrong positional encoding → meaningless embeddings
- **Fix**: Apply proper patching in data pipeline before encoding

### 2. **Encoder Frozen** 🚨 CRITICAL  
**Finding**: Our trainer can't find transformer blocks, so encoder stays frozen (linear probe only).
- **Impact**: Missing ~0.05 AUC improvement from fine-tuning
- **Fix**: Fix block detection and allow unfreezing last N layers

### 3. **Data Starvation** ⚠️ HIGH
**Finding**: Undersampling reduced training from 3,077 → 564 samples.
- **Impact**: Not enough data for transformer learning
- **Fix**: Use full dataset with pos_weight class balancing

### 4. **Input Standardization Missing** ⚠️ HIGH
**Finding**: PAT was pretrained on standardized data, but we feed raw counts.
- **Impact**: Distribution mismatch → poor transfer learning
- **Fix**: Apply StandardScaler before patching

### 5. **Wrong Loss Function** ⚠️ MEDIUM
**Finding**: We use FocalLoss, paper uses BinaryCrossentropy.
- **Impact**: Unnecessary complexity, unstable training
- **Fix**: Switch to BCE with pos_weight

## Paper's Actual Depression Results
- **PAT-S**: 0.589 average AUC (not 0.80!)
- **PAT-L**: 0.589 average AUC  
- **PAT Conv-L**: 0.611 average AUC (best)
- **Best baseline (3D CNN)**: 0.565 average AUC

## Implementation Checklist

### Immediate Fixes (Priority 1)
- [ ] Fix patching: reshape (10080,) → (560, 18) → mean → (560,)
- [ ] Enable encoder fine-tuning with proper layer detection
- [ ] Remove undersampling, use full dataset
- [ ] Add input standardization

### Training Configuration (Priority 2)
- [ ] Loss: BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=10.9)
- [ ] Learning rates: head=5e-3, encoder=1e-5
- [ ] Early stopping: patience=250 on val_auc
- [ ] Architecture: GlobalAvgPool → Dropout(0.1) → Dense(128) → Dense(1)

### Validation (Priority 3)
- [ ] Add attention visualization for explainability
- [ ] Verify attention focuses on circadian patterns
- [ ] Compare with paper's reported metrics

## Expected Outcomes
With these fixes, we should see:
- Validation AUC > 0.60 by epoch 3
- Logit separation ~0.15 (vs current 0.01)
- Final AUC ~0.58-0.61 (matching paper)

## Next Steps
1. Implement patching fix in nhanes_processor.py
2. Fix encoder unfreezing in population_trainer.py
3. Run smoke test with 500 samples
4. If successful, run full training
