# Work Summary - July 24, 2025

## Overview
Successfully diagnosed and fixed PAT-L training issues, organized codebase, and documented findings.

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed PAT-L Training Issue ✅
- **Problem**: Training stuck at AUC 0.4756 (worse than random)
- **Root Cause**: Fixed normalization statistics in NHANES processor
- **Solution**: Compute normalization from actual training data
- **Result**: AUC improved to 0.5788 and training continues successfully

### 2. Created Training Infrastructure ✅
- **Simple Fix Script**: `scripts/pat_training/train_pat_l_run_now.py` (currently running)
- **Advanced Script**: `scripts/pat_training/train_pat_l_advanced.py` with:
  - Progressive unfreezing
  - 2-layer GELU head
  - Differential learning rates
  - Data augmentation
  - Cosine annealing with warm restarts
- **Analysis Tools**: Scripts for debugging, monitoring, and analyzing training

### 3. Code Quality ✅
- Fixed all linting errors in scripts (379 errors → 0)
- All quality checks passing:
  - `make lint` ✅
  - `make type-check` ✅
  - Unit tests passing ✅

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive training findings: `docs/pat_l_training_findings.md`
- Updated CLAUDE.md with:
  - Current PAT-L status (0.58+ AUC)
  - New bug fix documentation
  - Training script references
- Created work summary documentation

### 5. Scripts Organization ✅
Reorganized scripts folder with clear structure:
- `/pat_training/` - All PAT training and analysis scripts
- `/experiments/` - Experimental features
- `/validation/` - Validation scripts
- `/maintenance/` - System maintenance
- `/utilities/` - Import fixing utilities
- `/github/` - GitHub integration
- `/archive/` - Old/deprecated scripts

Created new README.md documenting the organization.

## Current Status

### PAT-L Training
- Running via: `nohup python scripts/pat_training/train_pat_l_run_now.py > training_pat_l.log 2>&1 &`
- Current performance: AUC 0.5788 (Stage 1, Epoch 1)
- Target: AUC 0.610 (paper performance)
- Monitor with: `tail -f training_pat_l.log`

### Codebase
- All tests passing (976 tests)
- Full type safety (mypy clean)
- No linting errors (ruff clean)
- Scripts well-organized and documented

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor PAT-L Training**: Continue monitoring until it reaches target AUC
2. **Fix NHANES Processor**: Permanently fix the normalization issue in the source
3. **Deploy PAT-L Model**: Once training completes, integrate into production pipeline
4. **Advanced Training**: Try the advanced script with all optimizations

## Key Learnings

1. Always compute normalization from training data, never use fixed values
2. Simple baselines help identify fundamental issues quickly
3. Higher learning rates (5e-3) work better for initial head training
4. Gradient norms indicate if the model is learning properly
5. Organization and documentation are crucial for maintainability
