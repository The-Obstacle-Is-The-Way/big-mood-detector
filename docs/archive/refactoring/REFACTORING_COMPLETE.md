## 🧪 Test-Driven Development Process

### TDD Cycle Applied
1. **🔴 RED**: Write failing test first
2. **🟢 GREEN**: Implement minimal code to pass
3. **🔵 REFACTOR**: Clean up while keeping tests green

### Test Statistics
- **Total Tests**: 488
- **Test Coverage**: 80%+
- **Test Execution Time**: < 15 seconds
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit Tests: 420
  - Integration Tests: 68
  - Clinical Validation Tests: 35

## 🎨 Design Patterns Applied

### Creational Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Parser creation, Strategy selection
- **Builder Pattern**: Complex object construction
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based DI throughout

### Structural Patterns
- **Facade Pattern**: Clinical and Feature orchestrators

2. **Efficiency**: Optimized algorithms in focused services
3. **Caching**: Smart caching where appropriate
4. **Parallelization**: Services designed for concurrent execution

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **TDD First**: Writing tests first clarified requirements
2. **Small PRs**: Incremental changes easier to review
3. **Value Objects**: Immutable objects prevented bugs
4. **Dependency Injection**: Made testing trivial

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Legacy Dependencies**: Gradually introduced abstractions
2. **Complex Business Logic**: Extracted to domain services

2. **Performance**: Profile and optimize hot paths
3. **Monitoring**: Add metrics for production observability

### Long Term
1. **Event Sourcing**: Consider for audit requirements
2. **CQRS**: Separate read/write models if needed
3. **Microservices**: Services ready for extraction if needed
4. **ML Pipeline**: Standardize ML model integration
