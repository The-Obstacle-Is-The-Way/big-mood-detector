# Refactoring Progress Report

## Phase 1: ClinicalInterpreter Decomposition âœ… COMPLETED

Successfully extracted 4 specialized services from the god class ClinicalInterpreter:

1. **DSM5CriteriaEvaluator** - Evaluates DSM-5 criteria for mood episodes
2. **RiskLevelAssessor** - Assesses clinical risk levels with trajectory analysis
3. **EarlyWarningDetector** - Detects early warning signs of mood episodes
4. **ClinicalDecisionEngine** - Orchestrates clinical decision-making

**Results:**
- ClinicalInterpreter now acts as a Facade, delegating to specialized services
- All tests pass (402 passed, 1 skipped)
- Full backward compatibility maintained
- Clean separation of concerns achieved

## Phase 2: AdvancedFeatureEngineering Decomposition ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS

### Phase 2.2: Extract SleepFeatureCalculator âœ… COMPLETED

**What was done:**
1. Created comprehensive TDD tests for SleepFeatureCalculator (10 tests)
2. Implemented SleepFeatureCalculator with methods:
   - `calculate_regularity_index()` - Sleep schedule consistency (0-100)
   - `calculate_interdaily_stability()` - Circadian rhythm stability (0-1)
   - `calculate_intradaily_variability()` - Sleep fragmentation (0-2)
   - `calculate_relative_amplitude()` - Rhythm strength (0-1)
   - `calculate_sleep_window_percentages()` - Short/long sleep analysis
   - `calculate_timing_variances()` - Sleep/wake time variances

3. Refactored AdvancedFeatureEngineer to use SleepFeatureCalculator
4. Commented out redundant methods for future removal
5. All tests pass, lint and type checks clean

**Benefits achieved:**
- Single Responsibility: Sleep calculations isolated
- Testability: 100% test coverage for sleep features
- Reusability: Calculator can be used independently
- Maintainability: Changes to sleep logic contained

### Next Steps:

**Phase 2.3: Extract CircadianFeatureCalculator**
- L5/M10 calculation (least/most active hours)
- Circadian phase advance/delay detection
- DLMO (Dim Light Melatonin Onset) estimation
- Core body temperature nadir estimation

**Phase 2.4: Extract ActivityFeatureCalculator**
- Activity fragmentation analysis
- Sedentary bout statistics
- Activity intensity ratios

**Phase 2.5: Extract TemporalFeatureCalculator**
- Rolling window statistics
- Cross-domain temporal patterns

## Phase 3: MoodPredictionPipeline Decomposition âœ… COMPLETED

### Phase 3.3: Extract AggregationPipeline âœ… COMPLETED

**What was done:**
1. Successfully extracted complex aggregation logic from MoodPredictionPipeline
2. Created AggregationPipeline service that handles:
   - Daily feature aggregation across all domains
   - Rolling window statistics (30-day windows)
   - Sleep window analysis and circadian metrics
   - Statistical calculations (mean, std, z-scores)
   - Feature normalization and export utilities

3. Refactored MoodPredictionPipeline to use clean delegation:
   - `_extract_daily_features()` now simply calls `aggregation_pipeline.aggregate_daily_features()`
   - Removed 300+ lines of complex aggregation logic
   - Maintained full backward compatibility

**Results:**
- **957 lines â†’ 636 lines** (33% reduction, 321 lines removed)
- All 475 tests still passing
- Clean separation of concerns: Pipeline orchestrates, AggregationPipeline calculates
- Single Responsibility: Each component has focused purpose

## Key Metrics

- **Lines refactored**: ~1,500 lines across 3 major god classes
- **New services created**: 6 specialized services + AggregationPipeline
- **Line reduction**: 33% reduction in MoodPredictionPipeline
- **Test coverage**: Maintained at high level (475 tests passing)
- **Technical debt reduced**: Massive improvement in maintainability

## Clean Code Principles Applied

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has one clear purpose
2. **Dependency Injection**: All services injected via constructors
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed
4. **Facade Pattern**: Backward compatibility maintained
5. **Value Objects**: Immutable results for thread safety
