# Big Mood Detector Training Summary

## Current Status (July 25, 2025)

### Production Model
**PAT-Conv-L v0.5929** - Our best performing model
- Location: `model_weights/production/pat_conv_l_v0.5929.pth`
- Trained: July 25, 2025
- Performance: 0.5929 AUC (3.2% below paper's 0.625 target)
- Ready for MVP integration ✅

### Key Achievements

1. **Fixed critical normalization bug** 
   - Was causing AUC of 0.4756 (worse than random)
   - Now achieving 0.5929 (meaningful predictions)

2. **Validated PyTorch implementation**
   - Successfully ported from TensorFlow
   - Weight conversion verified to 0.000006 max difference

3. **Discovered Conv variant performs better**
   - PAT-Conv-L (0.5929) > PAT-L (0.5888)
   - Uses convolutional patch embedding

### For Researchers

To help us reach the paper's 0.625 AUC target, please review:
- `docs/training/PAT_CONV_L_ACHIEVEMENT.md` - Full training details
- Questions about data augmentation, ensemble methods, preprocessing

### For Developers

When loading models in the app:
```python
# Always use production path
MODEL_PATH = "model_weights/production/pat_conv_l_v0.5929.pth"

# Not these old paths:
# ❌ model_weights/pat/pytorch/pat_conv_l_simple_best.pth
# ❌ docs/archive/pat_experiments/...
```

### Next Steps

1. **Integrate PAT-Conv-L into MVP** ✅ Ready
2. **Continue research to reach 0.625 AUC**
3. **Set up automated model versioning**
4. **Create model evaluation pipeline**
