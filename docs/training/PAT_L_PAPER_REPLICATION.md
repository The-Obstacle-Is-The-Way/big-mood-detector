# PAT-L Paper Replication for Depression Detection

## Overview

This document details our exact replication of the PAT-L depression detection results from the paper "AI Foundation Models for Wearable Movement Data in Mental Health Research" by Ruan et al.

## Paper Target: 0.610 AUC

From careful analysis of the paper:
- **PAT Conv-L**: 0.610 AUC (average across dataset sizes)
- **PAT-L (standard)**: 0.589 AUC 
- **Best single result**: 0.624-0.625 AUC with n=2,800 samples

## Key Paper Methodology

### 1. Architecture
- **Encoder**: Pretrained PAT-L (1.99M parameters)
- **Classification Head**: "Small feed forward layer and sigmoid activation"
- **Training**: Full fine-tuning (FT), not just linear probing

### 2. Data
- **Dataset**: NHANES 2013-2014 with PHQ-9 scores
- **Labels**: PHQ-9 ≥ 10 = depressed (1), otherwise 0
- **Training samples**: Up to 2,800
- **Test set**: 2,000 held-out participants

### 3. Training Details
- Completed in "under six hours on Colab Pro"
- Class imbalance handled (implicit in results)
- No mention of complex architectures or techniques

## Our Implementation

### Stage 1: Frozen Encoder Training
```python
# Train only the head with frozen encoder
model.freeze_encoder()
optimizer = optim.Adam(filter(lambda p: p.requires_grad, model.parameters()), lr=1e-3)
# Train for ~20 epochs until convergence
```

### Stage 2: Full Fine-Tuning
```python
# Unfreeze encoder and use differential learning rates
model.unfreeze_encoder()
optimizer = optim.Adam([
    {'params': model.encoder.parameters(), 'lr': 5e-5},
    {'params': model.head.parameters(), 'lr': 5e-4}
])
# Train for up to 50 epochs with cosine annealing
```

### Key Differences from Initial Attempts

1. **Two-Stage Training**: Start with frozen encoder, then full fine-tuning
2. **Differential Learning Rates**: Encoder (5e-5) vs Head (5e-4)
3. **Simple Architecture**: Just 2-layer MLP, not complex multi-layer heads
4. **Proper Initialization**: Xavier uniform for weights
5. **Learning Rate Scheduling**: Cosine annealing

## Current Status

Training is running on RTX 4090 GPU with:
- ✅ Pretrained weights loaded successfully
- ✅ Data normalization fixed (mean: 0.0123, std: 0.3167)
- ✅ GPU acceleration enabled (~11s per epoch)
- ✅ Two-stage training implemented

## Expected Timeline

Based on paper's "under 6 hours" on Colab:
- Our RTX 4090 is ~10x faster than Colab's T4
- Stage 1: ~4 minutes (20 epochs × 11s)
- Stage 2: ~9 minutes (50 epochs × 11s)
- **Total: ~15 minutes** to complete

## Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Watch live training
tmux attach -t pat-paper

# Check progress without attaching
./scripts/monitor_training.sh

# View detailed logs
tail -f logs/pat_training/paper_exact_*.log
```

## Next Steps

1. Let training complete (~15 minutes)
2. Verify we achieve ~0.610 AUC
3. If needed, try PAT Conv-L variant (paper shows it performed better)
4. Document final hyperparameters for reproducibility

## Key Insights

The paper's success likely came from:
1. **Simplicity**: Not overengineering the classification head
2. **Proper fine-tuning**: Full model adaptation, not just linear probing
3. **Two-stage approach**: Gradual unfreezing prevents catastrophic forgetting
4. **Appropriate learning rates**: Much lower for pretrained encoder

This replication demonstrates that achieving paper results requires careful attention to methodology, not just advanced architectures.
