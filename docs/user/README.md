## Understanding Your Results

Reports show two complementary views:
- **Current State** (PAT) - Your mood right now based on past 7 days
- **Tomorrow's Risk** (XGBoost) - Prediction for next 24 hours

Both are important for different reasons. Current state helps you understand where you are, future risk helps you prepare.
