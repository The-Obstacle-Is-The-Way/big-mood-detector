Thanks for the detailed confirmation—I'll gather a curated set of 15–20 high-impact papers that are directly relevant to your bipolar mood detection system. These will include actionable research on feature engineering, model heuristics, clinical thresholds, and validation methods using Apple HealthKit-compatible signals like sleep, activity, and heart rate.

I’ll organize them by thematic relevance—bipolar-specific biomarkers, wearable-derived features, circadian indicators, HRV and mood correlations, and clinical risk thresholds—focusing on studies with directly implementable algorithms or parameters.

I’ll let you know once the literature set is ready for backend integration.


**Target Literature Domains:** We will focus on **bipolar disorder** (primary) and closely related areas like major depression, circadian rhythm disruptions, and sleep/activity-based mood forecasting (secondary). These directly tie into our Apple HealthKit signals (sleep, activity, heart rate) and provide context for mood state detection.

**Use-Case Driven Selection:** We should ingest papers that inform **four key areas** of our system: (1) **Wearable Feature Engineering** – how to extract meaningful features from HealthKit data (sleep duration, HRV, activity patterns, etc.), (2) **Clinical Thresholds & Rules** – established cutoffs or warning signs for mood episodes (e.g. scoring thresholds, sleep loss triggers), (3) **Modeling Heuristics** – proven algorithms or machine learning approaches for mood prediction, and (4) **Validation Evidence** – studies confirming that these features and models correlate with real clinical outcomes. Each paper must contain **actionable methods or findings** we can implement (e.g. specific features, algorithms, or decision rules).

**Preferred Sources:** Emphasis on *peer-reviewed studies* (both classic and modern). We can include a few high-quality recent preprints if they offer novel, implementable insights (e.g. a 2025 arXiv paper with a new wearable ML model). Every selected paper should contribute something concrete – an algorithm, a feature set, a biomarker threshold – rather than just theory.

**Recommended Number & Organization:** Approximately **15–20 papers** total, beyond the 6 core studies we already have. To avoid overload, we’ll curate them in five groups:

* **(5–6)** *Bipolar Disorder Digital Biomarkers:* Landmark studies linking wearable or phone data to bipolar mood changes. For example, the **MONARCA trial (2015)** showed smartphone sensor metrics (calls, texts, self-reported mood) correlate strongly with clinical bipolar mood ratings, establishing that passive data can serve as “electronic biomarkers” of mood. A 2021 systematic review (“Apps and Gaps in BD”) surveyed dozens of such digital monitoring studies to identify what has worked for episode prediction. More recently, **Lipschitz et al. (2023)** used 9 months of Fitbit data from 54 bipolar patients to detect mood episodes with \~89% accuracy for mania and 80% for depression – demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with entirely passive, real-world data. These papers will guide which signals (e.g. activity levels, sleep variability, phone use) are most indicative of mood swings, and how to combine them in models. We’ll also include overviews like a 2020 *evidence map* by Scott *et al.* that distilled 50+ years of actigraphy research in BD: it found that **the amount, timing, and day-to-day variability of activity/rest rhythms** are consistently predictive of mood state changes, more so than simple sleep-quality metrics. This kind of insight directs us to focus on features like activity level variance, sleep timing shifts, etc.

* **(4–5)** *Wearable Data Feature Engineering:* References that teach how to extract and select features from raw wearable streams (especially relevant to Apple HealthKit data). We’ve integrated **tsfresh** for automated feature generation, so including the foundational paper from Blue Yonder (2017) helps us understand its feature relevance test approach. Additionally, recent research on multi-sensor wearables will be useful – e.g. a 2025 study by Ouzar *et al.* (preprint) that used **wearable-derived behavioral and physiological markers** to differentiate unipolar vs. bipolar depression severity. Such work can inform which HealthKit signals (sleep, steps, heart rate, etc.) best distinguish bipolar patterns. We should also include any available guidance on Apple’s sensors specifically. (While there’s no Apple-exclusive study, the **Harvard 2024** Fitbit paper is a good proxy: it defined 15 features – total sleep, REM %, steps, sedentary time, resting HR, etc. – that improved bipolar episode prediction. We can mirror these features in our pipeline.) Overall, this set of papers will ensure our feature extraction methods are in line with best practices from wearable computing research.

* **(3–4)** *Circadian Rhythm & Sleep Indicators:* These papers cover the biologic patterns underlying mood episodes. We already have the 2024 Seoul study demonstrating that **circadian phase shifts are the strongest predictors** (phase delays foreshadow depression, advances foreshadow mania). To supplement, we’ll add classic findings and modern circadian studies: for instance, **Wehr (1987)** showed that even a single night of sleep deprivation can trigger mania in bipolar patients – highlighting how tightly sleep loss links to mood elevation. More recently, a Lancet Psychiatry commentary (2020) noted bipolar patients often show a **4–5 hour shift in circadian gene expression and cortisol rhythm** compared to healthy individuals, underlining intrinsic clock differences. Including a few such papers will give our AI a deeper understanding of why stable sleep-wake cycles are crucial. Practically, they translate into heuristic rules like “flag large bedtime shifts or reduced sleep as high-risk.” We’ll also incorporate studies on **social rhythm regularity** (e.g. Ellen Frank’s work), which emphasize maintaining consistent daily routines to prevent episodes. All these will ensure our system’s logic (and any alerts it generates) align with well-established circadian science in psychiatry.

* **(2–3)** *Heart Rate & Physiology Papers:* Since Apple Watch provides heart rate and possibly HRV, we need literature on cardiovascular signals in mood disorders. Research consistently shows **heart rate variability (HRV) is reduced during acute mood episodes** and in bipolar disorder generally, reflecting autonomic dysregulation. For example, multiple studies have found **lower HRV corresponds to higher symptom severity** and even euthymic bipolar patients tend to have blunted HRV compared to controls. A 2021 study (Ortiz *et al.*) reported that lower HRV was associated with greater illness burden in BD. Another recent study (Stautland *et al.*, 2023) confirmed **HRV drops significantly during manic phases** relative to euthymia. We will include a small set of such papers, as they provide concrete physiological markers (e.g. certain HRV metrics falling below a threshold could signal relapse risk). Additionally, if available, we’ll add any papers on other wearables signals like skin temperature or electrodermal activity in mood disorders (the TIMEBASE study already gives us one reference for those signals). These sources will directly inform how we handle HealthKit’s heart rate/HRV data – for instance, implementing monitoring for sustained HRV decreases or unusual heart rate elevations as potential warning signs.

* **(2–3)** *Clinical Risk Detection & Early Warning:* Finally, we’ll gather papers that discuss **early intervention algorithms or clinical rule-sets** for mood episode prevention. This might include studies that set specific *thresholds* or criteria for detecting an oncoming episode using behavioral data. For example, the Harvard/Brigham study defined clinical cutoff scores (PHQ-8 ≥10 for depression, ASRM ≥6 for mania) to label episodes – our system could use similar scoring triggers. Another paper (Llamocca *et al.*, 2022) attempted to **forecast bipolar depressive relapses using wearables and self-reports**, and concluded that bipolar mood prediction likely needs a personalized approach (generic models that worked for unipolar depression were insufficient). This tells us we may need patient-specific baselines or adaptive thresholds in our AI logic. We’ll also look at any “early warning” frameworks (e.g. trials where alerts were sent to patients or clinicians when certain patterns emerged). While these tend to be exploratory, they can guide how we design alert thresholds or what “hard rules” to bake in (for instance, a rule like “>30% drop in 7-day average sleep compared to personal baseline = flag for mania” can be inspired by such literature). Including a couple of papers or guidelines from psychiatry on managing prodromal symptoms will ensure our system’s recommendations are clinically sound (avoiding false alarms but catching true risks).

**Summary:** In total, adding \~15 carefully chosen papers spanning the above categories will strengthen our backend knowledge. This ensures all heuristic rules and model features we implement are grounded in reputable research. The selection is balanced between **classic insights** (to not miss well-known patterns) and **cutting-edge studies** (so we leverage the latest proven techniques). With these references ingested, our AI agents can draw on a rich, literature-backed context when analyzing Apple HealthKit data for mood episode prediction.

Each paper in this list has *direct actionable value* for our project – whether it’s a formula for a circadian index, a set of features to compute, a machine-learning approach to emulate, or a clinical threshold to monitor. By focusing on these high-yield sources, we avoid overloading the system with superfluous info and stick to what will genuinely help us build the most effective bipolar mood detector.
