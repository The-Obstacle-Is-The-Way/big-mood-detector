# v0.2.0 Release Notes - Honest Update

**Release Date:** 2025-07-20  
**Type:** Documentation Correction & Transparency Update

## What Changed

### Documentation Updates
We discovered that our documentation overstated the capabilities of the current implementation. This release corrects those claims while maintaining all existing functionality.

### Key Clarifications

**What v0.2.0 Actually Does:**
- ✅ **XGBoost predictions work perfectly** - Validated mood risk scores (0.80-0.98 AUC)
- ✅ **PAT provides activity embeddings** - 96-dimensional features that enhance predictions
- ✅ **Feature engineering** - PAT embeddings concatenated with XGBoost features
- ❌ **Not a true ensemble** - Only XGBoost makes predictions currently

**What We Originally Claimed:**
- Two independent models making predictions ❌
- Ensemble voting between models ❌
- PAT detecting depression independently ❌

## Technical Details

### Current Implementation
```python
# What actually happens in v0.2.0:
pat_embeddings = pat.extract_features(activity)      # 96-dim vector
combined = concat(xgb_features[:20], pat_embeddings[:16])
prediction = xgboost.predict(combined)               # Only XGBoost predicts
```

### Coming in v0.3.0
```python
# True ensemble implementation:
xgb_pred = xgboost.predict(features)               # Independent prediction
pat_pred = pat.predict_mood(activity)              # Independent prediction
ensemble = weighted_average(xgb_pred, pat_pred)    # True ensemble
```

- XGBoost predictions remain validated and accurate
- Processing pipelines unchanged
- API/CLI interfaces unchanged

### Better Expectations
- Clear understanding of current capabilities
- Transparent roadmap to improvements
- Honest assessment of limitations
- Path for community contributions

## Next Steps

### For Users
1. Continue using v0.2.0 - XGBoost predictions are excellent
2. Understand current limitations
3. Watch for v0.3.0 with true ensemble

### For Contributors
1. Help implement PAT classification heads
2. Use NHANES data (already included)
3. Enable true dual predictions
4. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details

## Acknowledgments

Thank you to the external auditor who identified the documentation issues. This transparency update ensures users have accurate expectations while we work toward delivering the originally envisioned dual-model system.

## Migration Notes

No code changes required. This is a documentation-only update that clarifies existing functionality.
