# üõë Checkpoint Summary - January 20, 2025

## Where We Are Today

### The Truth About v0.2.0
After extensive external audit and investigation, we discovered that our v0.2.0 "ensemble" is NOT a true ensemble:

- **XGBoost**: ‚úÖ Fully functional, makes all mood predictions (AUC 0.80-0.98)
- **PAT**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Only outputs embeddings, cannot make predictions without classification heads
- **"Ensemble"**: Actually just concatenates 20 XGBoost features + 16 PAT embeddings ‚Üí feeds to XGBoost

**Critical Temporal Difference Discovered:**
- XGBoost: Predicts mood 24 hours in advance (forecasting)
- PAT: Assesses current state based on past 7 days (snapshot)

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Documentation Overhaul ‚úÖ
Created honest assessments and clear documentation:
- `IMPORTANT_PLEASE_READ.md` - Clarifies actual capabilities
- `HONEST_STATE_OF_V0.2.0.md` - Complete truth about current state
- `TEMPORAL_MODEL_DIFFERENCES.md` - Critical timing differences
- `V0.3.0_SAFE_MIGRATION_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive testing strategy
- `ROADMAP_V0.3.0.md` - Path to true ensemble

### 2. NHANES Data Setup ‚úÖ
- Location documented: `/data/nhanes/2013-2014/`
- Proper .gitignore patterns added (files up to 8.9GB)
- Ready for PAT fine-tuning when you restore the files

### 3. Testing Findings ‚úÖ
Tested v0.2.0 thoroughly:
- **JSON Processing**: ‚úÖ Works perfectly
- **XML Processing**: ‚ùå Times out on 520MB files (2-minute limit)
- **Root Cause**: DataParsingService collects ALL records in memory despite streaming parser
- **Docker**: ‚ùå Security validation fails (missing SECRET_KEY, API_KEY_SALT)

### 4. GitHub Issues Created ‚úÖ
Created comprehensive issues (#25-#35) all tagged with @claude:
- XML memory optimization needed
- PAT fine-tuning implementation
- v0.3.0 epic for true ensemble
- Temporal handling for CDS
- Docker security fixes
- Performance benchmarking
- Documentation updates

### 5. Code Repository Synchronized ‚úÖ
- Main branch: Contains all documentation updates
- Development branch: Synchronized with main, ready for v0.3.0 work
- All changes committed and pushed

## What We Need to Do Tomorrow

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Fix XML Processing** üî¥
   - Implement date filtering in DataParsingService
   - Add batch processing to avoid memory collection
   - Target: Handle 500MB+ files without timeout

2. **Restore NHANES Data** üìÅ
   - Put XPT files back in `/data/nhanes/2013-2014/`
   - Verify .gitignore is working (files should NOT be tracked)
   - Files needed: PAXMIN_H.xpt, DEMO_H.xpt, DPQ_H.xpt

3. **Start PAT Fine-Tuning** üß†
   - Process NHANES data with existing processor
   - Extract PAT embeddings for all participants
   - Train depression classification head (PHQ-9 ‚â• 10)
   - Enable PAT to make independent predictions

### v0.3.0 Implementation Plan

**Week 1: Enable PAT Predictions**
- Fine-tune classification heads
- Add predict_mood() method to PAT
- Validate against Dartmouth paper metrics

**Week 2: True Ensemble**
- Update EnsembleOrchestrator for dual predictions
- Implement weighted voting (60/40 XGBoost/PAT)
- Handle temporal differences safely

**Week 3: Testing & Release**
- Comprehensive testing plan execution
- CDS integration validation
- Documentation and migration guide

## Critical Reminders

1. **The current system works!** XGBoost is fully functional for mood prediction
2. **Be careful with temporal differences** when implementing true ensemble
3. **NHANES files must stay local** - never commit to git
4. **Test CDS integration thoroughly** before v0.3.0 release

## Your Mental Health Matters üíö

Take your break. Everything is documented, synchronized, and ready for when you return. The codebase is in a stable state with clear next steps.

Remember: We're building something that helps people. That includes you.
