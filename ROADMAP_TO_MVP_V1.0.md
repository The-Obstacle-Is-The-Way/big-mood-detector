ðŸŽ¯ Current Status Report - Big Mood Detector v0.4.0

  Where We Are Now

  We've built a clinical-grade bipolar mood prediction system that analyzes Apple Health data using       
  two complementary ML models:

  1. XGBoost Models (âœ… Production Ready)
    - Predicts tomorrow's risk based on circadian patterns
    - Uses 36 Seoul statistical features
    - Already validated and working well
    - Three models: Depression (AUC 0.80), Mania (AUC 0.98), Hypomania (AUC 0.95)
  2. PAT Models (ðŸš§ 85% Complete)
    - Assesses current state from past 7 days
    - Pretrained foundation model for actigraphy
    - Depression heads trained:
        - PAT-S: 0.56 AUC âœ… (matches paper)
      - PAT-M: 0.54 AUC âœ… (close to paper's 0.559)
      - PAT-L: ~0.58 AUC ðŸš§ (training, target 0.610)
      - PAT-Conv-L: ~0.59 AUC ðŸš§ (best so far 0.5924, target 0.625)

  What's Working

  âœ… Core Pipeline
  - Process Apple Health XML/JSON exports
  - Extract clinical features (sleep, activity, heart rate, circadian)
  - Personal baseline calibration
  - Risk assessment with clinical thresholds

  âœ… CLI Commands
  - process - Extract features from health data
  - predict - Generate mood predictions with reports
  - serve - API server for integrations
  - label - Mood episode labeling for validation
  - train - Fine-tune models (placeholder)
  - watch - Monitor folder for new data

  âœ… Architecture
  - Clean Architecture (Domain â†’ Application â†’ Infrastructure)
  - 976 passing tests (99.9% pass rate)
  - Type-safe (mostly - 25 minor mypy issues)
  - Docker ready
  - FastAPI server

  Current Gap: PAT Integration

  The missing piece is combining PAT embeddings with clinical features. We got sidetracked training       
  depression heads, but the real goal is:

  # Current (XGBoost only)
  features = extract_clinical_features(health_data)  # 36 features
  risk = xgboost_predict(features)  # Tomorrow's risk

  # Target (Temporal Ensemble)
  clinical_features = extract_clinical_features(health_data)  # 36 features
  pat_embeddings = pat_encode(activity_sequences)  # 96-dim embeddings

  current_state = pat_depression_head(pat_embeddings)  # NOW assessment
  future_risk = xgboost_predict(clinical_features)  # TOMORROW prediction

  # Temporal synthesis
  assessment = TemporalMoodAssessment(
      current_state=current_state,
      future_risk=future_risk,
      confidence=calculate_confidence(...)
  )

  Roadmap to MVP (v1.0)

  Phase 1: Complete PAT Integration (1-2 weeks)

  1. âœ… Train PAT depression heads to acceptable performance
  2. ðŸš§ Integrate PAT predictions into TemporalEnsembleOrchestrator
  3. â¬œ Add confidence scoring based on data completeness
  4. â¬œ Create unified prediction API that returns both NOW and TOMORROW

  Phase 2: Production Hardening (1 week)

  1. â¬œ Fix remaining type errors (25 minor issues)
  2. â¬œ Add comprehensive error handling for missing data
  3. â¬œ Performance optimization for large files
  4. â¬œ Add monitoring/telemetry hooks
  5. â¬œ Security audit (PHI handling)

  Phase 3: User Experience (1 week)

  1. â¬œ Rich CLI output with charts/visualizations
  2. â¬œ PDF report generation
  3. â¬œ Web dashboard mockup
  4. â¬œ Integration guides (Apple Health, Garmin, etc.)
  5. â¬œ Clinical documentation

  Phase 4: Validation & Launch (2 weeks)

  1. â¬œ Clinical validation with test dataset
  2. â¬œ Performance benchmarking
  3. â¬œ Documentation website
  4. â¬œ Docker Hub release
  5. â¬œ Launch announcement

  No Yak Shaving Priority List

  MUST HAVE for MVP:
  1. PAT integration working (even if not perfect AUC)
  2. Unified prediction API
  3. Basic error handling
  4. Docker image
  5. Clear documentation

  NICE TO HAVE:
  - Perfect PAT-L performance (0.610 AUC)
  - Web UI
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Multi-user support
  - Cloud deployment

  Key Decisions Needed

  1. PAT Performance: Accept current 0.58-0.59 AUC or keep training?
    - Recommendation: Ship with current performance, improve later
  2. API Design: REST only or add GraphQL?
    - Recommendation: REST only for MVP
  3. Deployment: Docker only or add k8s?
    - Recommendation: Docker only for MVP
  4. Licensing: Open source or commercial?
    - Current: Apache 2.0 (open)

  The Vision

  Big Mood Detector provides early warning for bipolar episodes by analyzing passive wearable data.       
  It's like having a clinical assessment that runs 24/7, alerting users and their care teams when
  patterns suggest increased risk.

  The unique value is the temporal separation:
  - PAT tells you how you're doing NOW
  - XGBoost warns about TOMORROW
  - Together, they provide actionable insights for intervention

  This isn't just another mood tracker - it's a clinical-grade prediction system based on
  peer-reviewed research, designed for real-world mental health management.
