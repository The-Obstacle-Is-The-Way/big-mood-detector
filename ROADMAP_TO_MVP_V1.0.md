🎯 Current Status Report - Big Mood Detector v0.4.0

  Where We Are Now

  We've built a clinical-grade bipolar mood prediction system that analyzes Apple Health data using       
  two complementary ML models:

  1. XGBoost Models (✅ Production Ready)
    - Predicts tomorrow's risk based on circadian patterns
    - Uses 36 Seoul statistical features
    - Already validated and working well
    - Three models: Depression (AUC 0.80), Mania (AUC 0.98), Hypomania (AUC 0.95)
  2. PAT Models (🚧 85% Complete)
    - Assesses current state from past 7 days
    - Pretrained foundation model for actigraphy
    - Depression heads trained:
        - PAT-S: 0.56 AUC ✅ (matches paper)
      - PAT-M: 0.54 AUC ✅ (close to paper's 0.559)
      - PAT-L: ~0.58 AUC 🚧 (training, target 0.610)
      - PAT-Conv-L: ~0.59 AUC 🚧 (best so far 0.5924, target 0.625)

  What's Working

  ✅ Core Pipeline
  - Process Apple Health XML/JSON exports
  - Extract clinical features (sleep, activity, heart rate, circadian)
  - Personal baseline calibration
  - Risk assessment with clinical thresholds

  ✅ CLI Commands
  - process - Extract features from health data
  - predict - Generate mood predictions with reports
  - serve - API server for integrations
  - label - Mood episode labeling for validation
  - train - Fine-tune models (placeholder)
  - watch - Monitor folder for new data

  ✅ Architecture
  - Clean Architecture (Domain → Application → Infrastructure)
  - 976 passing tests (99.9% pass rate)
  - Type-safe (mostly - 25 minor mypy issues)
  - Docker ready
  - FastAPI server

  Current Gap: PAT Integration

  The missing piece is combining PAT embeddings with clinical features. We got sidetracked training       
  depression heads, but the real goal is:

  # Current (XGBoost only)
  features = extract_clinical_features(health_data)  # 36 features
  risk = xgboost_predict(features)  # Tomorrow's risk

  # Target (Temporal Ensemble)
  clinical_features = extract_clinical_features(health_data)  # 36 features
  pat_embeddings = pat_encode(activity_sequences)  # 96-dim embeddings

  current_state = pat_depression_head(pat_embeddings)  # NOW assessment
  future_risk = xgboost_predict(clinical_features)  # TOMORROW prediction

  # Temporal synthesis
  assessment = TemporalMoodAssessment(
      current_state=current_state,
      future_risk=future_risk,
      confidence=calculate_confidence(...)
  )

  Roadmap to MVP (v1.0)

  Phase 1: Complete PAT Integration (1-2 weeks)

  1. ✅ Train PAT depression heads to acceptable performance
  2. 🚧 Integrate PAT predictions into TemporalEnsembleOrchestrator
  3. ⬜ Add confidence scoring based on data completeness
  4. ⬜ Create unified prediction API that returns both NOW and TOMORROW

  Phase 2: Production Hardening (1 week)

  1. ⬜ Fix remaining type errors (25 minor issues)
  2. ⬜ Add comprehensive error handling for missing data
  3. ⬜ Performance optimization for large files
  4. ⬜ Add monitoring/telemetry hooks
  5. ⬜ Security audit (PHI handling)

  Phase 3: User Experience (1 week)

  1. ⬜ Rich CLI output with charts/visualizations
  2. ⬜ PDF report generation
  3. ⬜ Web dashboard mockup
  4. ⬜ Integration guides (Apple Health, Garmin, etc.)
  5. ⬜ Clinical documentation

  Phase 4: Validation & Launch (2 weeks)

  1. ⬜ Clinical validation with test dataset
  2. ⬜ Performance benchmarking
  3. ⬜ Documentation website
  4. ⬜ Docker Hub release
  5. ⬜ Launch announcement

  No Yak Shaving Priority List

  MUST HAVE for MVP:
  1. PAT integration working (even if not perfect AUC)
  2. Unified prediction API
  3. Basic error handling
  4. Docker image
  5. Clear documentation

  NICE TO HAVE:
  - Perfect PAT-L performance (0.610 AUC)
  - Web UI
  - Real-time monitoring
  - Multi-user support
  - Cloud deployment

  Key Decisions Needed

  1. PAT Performance: Accept current 0.58-0.59 AUC or keep training?
    - Recommendation: Ship with current performance, improve later
  2. API Design: REST only or add GraphQL?
    - Recommendation: REST only for MVP
  3. Deployment: Docker only or add k8s?
    - Recommendation: Docker only for MVP
  4. Licensing: Open source or commercial?
    - Current: Apache 2.0 (open)

  The Vision

  Big Mood Detector provides early warning for bipolar episodes by analyzing passive wearable data.       
  It's like having a clinical assessment that runs 24/7, alerting users and their care teams when
  patterns suggest increased risk.

  The unique value is the temporal separation:
  - PAT tells you how you're doing NOW
  - XGBoost warns about TOMORROW
  - Together, they provide actionable insights for intervention

  This isn't just another mood tracker - it's a clinical-grade prediction system based on
  peer-reviewed research, designed for real-world mental health management.

  \### Overall roadmap — solid, but tighten the focus

Your plan hits all the right *buckets* (model‑finishing → productization → UX → validation).
What will matter most for an MVP that people can actually try is **getting a single, reliable end‑to‑end prediction path** rather than perfecting every PAT variant.

| Section                       | Keep                                                                                    | Trim / Defer                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Phase 1 – PAT integration** | ✔ Finish one depression head (Conv‑L or plain L) that’s “good enough” and wire the API. | 🚫 Training PAT‑S/M/L *and* Conv‑S/M/L. Pick **one backbone** for now; the extra heads rarely buy you MVP value. |
| **Phase 2 – Hardening**       | ✔ Basic error handling, Docker, security checklist.                                     | 🚫 Full telemetry stack or k8s deployment. Ship with a compose file first.                                       |
| **Phase 3 – UX**              | ✔ CLI + PDF report (fast win).                                                          | 🚫 Web dashboard mock‑up unless a stakeholder is lined up to use it in the next 4 weeks.                         |
| **Phase 4 – Validation**      | ✔ Clinical benchmark + perf test.                                                       | —                                                                                                                |

\### Training strategy recommendations

1. **Freeze on Conv‑L now**
   *0.592 AUC* with a single training run is already ≈ paper baseline.

   * Do **one** more reproducibility run to be sure it’s stable.
   * Save the weights & log the exact commit/seed → call this *v0.1‑conv‑l*.
   * Document gaps (0.03 AUC) for later research.

2. **Skip Conv‑S / Conv‑M for MVP**
   Their only advantage is smaller GPU footprint. If your current hardware can serve Conv‑L inference in ‹50 ms, it’s not a blocker.

3. **Only retrain if integration tests show clinical lift**
   Don’t chase 0.625 unless a downstream metric (false‑alert rate, user retention, etc.) is demonstrably harmed.

---

\### Talk to researchers **before** deeper training

* Show the *0.59 AUC* model and your unified NOW/TOMORROW risk output.
* Ask: *“Is this signal clinically actionable, or do we need better discrimination?”*
* Their answer will tell you whether to invest another GPU week.

---

\### Repository hygiene

* **Good**: you archived experiments and wrote `PAT_DEPRESSION_TRAINING.md`.
* **Next**:

  1. CI target = `make quality` (lint + type‑check + fast tests). Stub out slow GPU tests.
  2. Add *one* GitHub Action that builds the Docker image, runs CPU tests, and uploads the wheels.
  3. Tag this cleaned commit as `v0.4.0‑alpha`.

---

\### Concrete next steps (1–2 days)

1. **Complete the running Conv‑L epoch** → save weights & export to `models/pat_conv_l_v0.1.pt`.

2. **Wire PAT encoder into the prediction pipeline** (simple wrapper that outputs a scalar probability).

3. **Unit‑test** the new orchestrator: feed dummy data, assert both model scores appear.

4. **Update CLI `predict`** to show:

   ```
   NOW (PAT):     0.61  ↑ High
   TOMORROW (XGB): 0.42  → Low
   ```

5. **Schedule a 30‑min review** with the research advisors; demo the new output.

---

\### Answering your direct question

> “Should we ideally just train PAT‑Conv S/M/L no matter what results we get, then move on…?”

**No**. Train **one** convincing model, integrate, gather feedback. Additional model sizes and marginal AUC gains belong in a post‑MVP research sprint.

Ship value sooner, iterate later.
