# Executive Summary: Big Mood Detector Analysis & Action Plan

**Date**: July 26, 2025  
**For**: Project Lead / Clinical Psychiatrist  
**Status**: System functional but requires critical fixes

## The Bottom Line

The Big Mood Detector successfully implements the ML models from the research papers, but has two critical issues preventing it from serving users effectively:

1. **Sleep calculations are wrong** - showing 12+ hours average (should be ~7-8 hours)
2. **Architecture forces both models to work together** - when they should run independently

Both issues have clear fixes that can be implemented quickly.

## What's Working Well âœ…

- PAT transformer models correctly implemented with all three sizes (S/M/L)
- XGBoost models properly converted and functional
- Clinical thresholds match DSM-5 criteria
- FastAPI server and CLI interface work smoothly
- 976 tests passing with >90% coverage
- Docker deployment ready

## Critical Issues Found ðŸ”´

### 1. Sleep Duration Bug (Data Integrity)
**Problem**: Your Apple Watch and iPhone both record sleep, creating overlaps. The system adds them together instead of merging, resulting in impossible values like 27 hours of sleep in a 24-hour day.

**Impact**: Models receive incorrect hypersomnia signals, potentially triggering false clinical alerts.

**Fix**: Use the overlap merging algorithm that already exists in the codebase (2 hour fix).

### 2. Pipeline Coupling (Architecture)
**Problem**: Built one pipeline requiring both PAT and XGBoost to have sufficient data, instead of two independent pipelines as the papers describe.

**Impact**: Users get no predictions unless they have BOTH 7 consecutive days (PAT) AND 30+ total days (XGBoost).

**Fix**: Split into independent pipelines that can run separately (2 day fix).

## Your Specific Data Results

Your 545MB export contained:
- Only 7 days of data (non-consecutive) over a 15-day period
- Average sleep showing as 12.29 hours (due to overlap bug)
- Neither model could run:
  - PAT needs 7 CONSECUTIVE days (you had gaps)
  - XGBoost needs 30+ days total (you only had 7)

## Immediate Action Plan

### Week 1: Critical Fixes
1. **Monday**: Fix sleep overlap bug (2 hours)
2. **Tuesday-Wednesday**: Split pipelines to run independently (2 days)
3. **Thursday**: Test with your data - should show ~7.5 hour sleep average
4. **Friday**: Deploy fixes and update documentation

### Week 2: User Experience
1. Add data quality assessment before processing
2. Implement intelligent window selection
3. Improve error messages with specific guidance
4. Add device preference settings (prefer Apple Watch over iPhone)

### Week 3: Polish
1. Add partial prediction support
2. Create data cleaning utilities
3. Enhance clinical reports
4. Update CLAUDE.md with new architecture

## Expected Outcomes After Fixes

### For Your Data:
- Sleep duration: ~7.5 hours (realistic)
- Clear message: "Need 7 consecutive days for depression screening"
- Clear message: "Need 23 more days for mood prediction"
- Guidance: "Try collecting data for a full week without gaps"

### For Users with More Data:
- PAT runs with any 7 consecutive days
- XGBoost runs with any 30+ days (gaps OK)
- Both run when possible, either runs when available
- Temporal ensemble combines results intelligently

## Clinical Implications

The current issues don't affect the validity of the ML models themselves - they're working correctly. The problems are in data preprocessing and pipeline orchestration. Once fixed:

1. **Data integrity**: Sleep metrics will reflect actual physiology
2. **Flexibility**: Partial predictions when full data isn't available
3. **Transparency**: Clear feedback about data quality and requirements
4. **Reliability**: Consistent results matching the published research

## Technical Debt Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Fixes don't change model behavior
- Test coverage ensures safety
- Changes are localized to specific modules

**Medium Risk**:
- Need to validate clinical accuracy after fixes
- Should review with sample patient data
- May need to retrain baselines

## Recommendation

Proceed with immediate fixes. The sleep bug is critical for data integrity, and the architecture split is essential for usability. Both can be completed within a week with minimal risk.

The system's core - the ML models and clinical logic - is solid. These fixes will unlock its full potential for helping patients monitor their mood episodes.

## Questions for Clinical Review

1. Should we prefer Apple Watch data over iPhone when both are available?
2. What's the minimum acceptable data quality for clinical use?
3. Should partial predictions include confidence scores?
4. How should we handle users with irregular sleep patterns?

*This system has strong foundations. With these targeted fixes, it will deliver on its promise of clinical-grade mood prediction from consumer wearable data.*
