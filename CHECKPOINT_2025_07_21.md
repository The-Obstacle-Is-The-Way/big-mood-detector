LOOK AT SLEEP CALCULATOR REGRESSION WARNING DURING MAKE TEST

# Checkpoint - July 21st, 2025

## Current Status

ðŸŽ‰ **Just Released**: v0.2.3 - Major performance improvements
- Fixed XML processing timeouts (#29) with 7x performance boost
- All branches synchronized (main, staging, development)
- 907 tests passing, clean CI/CD pipeline

## Repository State

- **Current Branch**: development
- **Version**: v0.2.3 (released today)
- **Test Coverage**: >90%
- **Documentation**: Reorganized, with archives in `docs/archive/`

## Today's Accomplishments

1. **Resolved Issue #29**: XML Streaming Performance
   - Root cause: O(nÃ—m) complexity in aggregation, not XML parsing
   - Solution: OptimizedAggregationPipeline with pre-indexing
   - Result: 365 days processed in 17.4s (was timeout >120s)

2. **Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Fixed flaky baseline repository tests
   - Added performance pytest markers
   - Cleaned up 10+ obsolete branches
   - Documented workflow in `docs/CLEANUP_AND_WORKFLOW.md`

## Open Issues Priority

### ðŸ”´ Next Up: Issue #40 - XGBoost predict_proba
**Why**: Blocks ensemble predictions and JSON model format adoption
```python
# Current error:
AttributeError: 'Booster' object has no attribute 'predict_proba'
```
**Solution Options**:
1. Custom wrapper with softmax
2. Patch Booster class 
3. Convert to XGBClassifier on load

### ðŸŸ  Then: Issue #27 - True Ensemble Implementation
**Why**: Core feature not actually working - PAT only provides embeddings
**Blocked by**: Need #40 fixed first

### ðŸŸ¡ Quick Wins Available:
- **Issue #31**: Progress bars (improve UX)
- **Issue #30**: Docker dev setup (help onboarding)

### ðŸ“Š Full Priority List:
1. #40 - XGBoost predict_proba (blocking ensemble)
2. #27 - True ensemble (core feature gap)  
3. #31 - Progress indication (UX)
4. #30 - Docker fixes (developer experience)
5. #25 - Temporal window documentation
6. #34 - XML test suite
7. #28 - v0.3.0 migration plan

## Development Workflow Reminder

```bash
# Start next issue
git checkout -b feature/issue-40-xgboost-predict-proba development

# TDD approach (from docs/CLEANUP_AND_WORKFLOW.md)
1. Write failing test first
2. Implement minimal solution
3. Refactor when green
4. Document changes
```

## Key Files for Context

- `CLAUDE.md` - AI agent instructions
- `docs/CLEANUP_AND_WORKFLOW.md` - Development workflow
- `docs/ISSUE_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Detailed issue analysis (archived)
- `src/big_mood_detector/infrastructure/ml_models/xgboost_models.py` - Where #40 fix goes

## Environment Notes

- Python 3.12.7
- macOS (Darwin 24.5.0)
- All dependencies in pyproject.toml
- Pre-push hooks configured (can bypass with --no-verify if needed)

## Next Session Quick Start

```bash
# Update and start fresh
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/issue-40-xgboost-predict-proba

# Activate environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run tests to ensure clean start
make test
```
