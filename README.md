A production-ready system for detecting mood episodes in bipolar disorder using wearable sensor data. Based on peer-reviewed research from Nature Digital Medicine, Harvard Medical School, and Dartmouth.

## 🎯 Understanding the Models

**What Each Model Does:**
- **XGBoost**: Predicts **tomorrow's** mood risk (24-hour forecast) based on 36 engineered features from the past 30 days
- **PAT (Pretrained Actigraphy Transformer)**: Analyzes the **last 7 days** of minute-by-minute activity to generate embeddings (not predictions)

**Current v0.2.4 Implementation:**
- ✅ **XGBoost predictions** - Fully validated next-day risk scores (0.80-0.98 AUC)
- ✅ **Feature extraction** - 36 clinical biomarkers from sleep, activity, and circadian patterns
- ✅ **PAT embeddings** - 96-dimensional activity features enhance XGBoost accuracy
- ✅ **Feature validation** - Automatic data quality checks and anomaly detection
- ⚠️ **"Ensemble" mode** - XGBoost enhanced with PAT embeddings (not true ensemble voting)

**Important Limitations:**
- ❌ **No current state assessment** - PAT needs fine-tuning to predict today's mood
- ❌ **Single predictor** - Only XGBoost makes actual predictions
- ❌ **Temporal mismatch** - XGBoost (next-day) vs PAT potential (current state)

**Coming in v0.3.0:** 
- True ensemble with PAT fine-tuned for current mood state predictions
- Separate "current risk" vs "tomorrow's risk" outputs
- Independent validation from two different model architectures

**Note:** This implementation has not been clinically validated. For research and personal use only.

## 🆕 What's New (v0.2.4)

- ✅ **Feature Engineering Orchestrator**: Automatic validation, anomaly detection, and data quality checks
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Fixed all mypy errors - full type coverage across the codebase
- ✅ **Test Stability**: Resolved baseline repository race conditions in parallel test execution
- ✅ **Better Documentation**: Clarified model capabilities and temporal prediction windows

### Previous Release (v0.2.3)
- 🚀 **7x Performance Boost**: Fixed XML processing timeouts - now handles 365 days in 17.4s (was 120s+)
- ✅ **Optimized Aggregation**: New O(n+m) pipeline with pre-indexing eliminates bottlenecks
- ✅ **Date Range Filtering**: Process large XML files with `--days-back` or `--date-range` options
- ✅ **Personal Baselines**: Adaptive predictions based on YOUR normal patterns

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.12 or higher
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended for large datasets)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows with WSL2

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/Clarity-Digital-Twin/big-mood-detector.git
cd big-mood-detector
pip install -e ".[dev,ml,monitoring]"

# Process health data
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process data/health_auto_export/

# Generate predictions
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py predict data/health_auto_export/ --report

# Start API server
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py serve
```

## 📊 Clinical Performance

XGBoost model validated on 168 patients over 44,787 observation days:

| Condition | Accuracy (AUC) | Prediction Window | Clinical Use |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Mania** | **0.98** ⭐ | Next 24 hours | Rule out bipolar episodes |
| **Hypomania** | **0.95** | Next 24 hours | Early warning system |
| **Depression** | **0.80** | Next 24 hours | Preventive interventions |

*Source: Nature Digital Medicine 2024 (Seoul National University)*

**Understanding the Predictions:**
- 📅 **Temporal Window**: XGBoost predicts **tomorrow's risk** (24-hour forecast)
- 📊 **Input Data**: Uses 30 days of historical patterns to make predictions
- 🔄 **PAT Role**: Currently provides activity embeddings to enhance XGBoost (not independent predictions)
- 🎯 **Clinical Use**: Best for early warning and preventive interventions

python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process export.xml --days-back 90

# Process a specific date range
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py process export.xml --date-range 2024-01-01:2024-03-31

# Same options work for predict command
python src/big_mood_detector/main.py predict export.xml --days-back 30 --report
```

This is especially useful for:
- Large Apple Health exports (years of data)
